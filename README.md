Rule Sets: 
Three types of rule sets are generated by ClassBench using default parameters (in README file), which are ACL, FW and IPC. The rule set size varies from 1k, 10k to 100k. For each size, 12 rule sets based on 12 seed parameter files (i.e, 5 ACL, 5 FW, and 2 IPC) are generated in ClassBench.
